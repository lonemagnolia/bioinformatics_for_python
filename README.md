Working through the Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook(3rd edition)

In order to learn appropriate tools and practices for bioinformatics, I started the *Bioinformatics with Python Cookbook* by Tiago Antao. 
I'm working using his associated Git repo from the publisher: <https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Bioinformatics-with-Python-Cookbook-third-edition/blob/main/README.md>

I'm adding my notes in to document my learning and understanding.
